# Kaggle-Competition 💎
For Ironhack bootcamp


**_Using machine learning, what is the best model to predict diamond's price?_**

![alt text](INPUT/imagen.jpg)




### RESUME👨🏻‍💻

The main objective of the competition was to train the best machine learning model in order to get the closest diamond's price prediction reaching the highest position against my bootcamps colleages.
We all have started with the same two CSV files, one for training the models and the other one to test them.

The difficulty was that we just had the 70% of the CSV data files, the other 30% was private so we could get an idea of what was our positions but they were not official.
  
### WORK PROCESS 💻 ⚙️

I mainly have worked in the two jupyter notebooks files ("Varios modelos.ipynb" and "trying h2o.ipynb") in which I have the same structure: first part for data cleaning and data preparing and second one in where I have been trying and imporving some machine learning models.

After that I exported my predictions to a CSV file and uploaded them to Kaggle.

To all this process I have used:

  - Python 3 
  - h2o and sklearn machine learning models
  - Visual Studio Code






Hope you like it.
